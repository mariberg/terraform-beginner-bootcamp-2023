      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 1889</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Licorice, also spelled as "liquorice," is a distinctive and versatile herb that has been cherished for centuries due to its unique flavor and various medicinal properties. Derived from the root of the Glycyrrhiza plant, licorice is renowned for its sweet and mildly anise-like taste, making it a popular ingredient in confectionery, herbal teas, and traditional remedies. With a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations, licorice has been used not only as a delightful candy but also for its potential health benefits, such as soothing sore throats and aiding digestion. Whether you enjoy it as a candy, tea, or a natural remedy, licorice offers a fascinating combination of flavor and healing properties that have stood the test of time.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Sweet licorice and salty licorice represent two distinct and intriguing variations of this beloved confection. Sweet licorice, often found in classic forms like twists or chewy bites, indulges the palate with a rich, sugary taste that's reminiscent of molasses or anise. It's a delightful treat for those who enjoy a milder and more traditional licorice experience. On the other hand, salty licorice, popular in Nordic countries, delivers a unique and acquired taste. Infused with ammonium chloride or salmiak, it offers a contrasting blend of salty and intense, savory notes that can be an acquired delight for licorice enthusiasts seeking a bold and unconventional flavor adventure. These two varieties cater to diverse preferences, making licorice a confectionery delight with something to offer for every palate.</p>
